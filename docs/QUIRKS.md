# QUIRKS — bug-for-bug / behavioral-divergence log

Per DESIGN.md §5 ("Bug-for-bug rules compat: keep a `QUIRKS.md` log of each
case"). Each entry records a place where our behavior deliberately matches an
original-engine quirk, or deliberately diverges from it, with the reasoning and
the reference-source citation so the decision is auditable.

## Q1 — Refinery destroyed while a harvester is unloading

**Milestone:** M6 (harvester economy, first surfaced by ra-tester's M5 edge test
`refinery_removed_while_unloading_drops_the_pending_credit_and_goes_idle`).

**Our behavior.** The harvest FSM (`ra-sim/src/world.rs::process_harvester`)
runs a `house_has_refinery` guard *before* the state match every tick. If a
house's last refinery is destroyed while one of its harvesters is in
`Unloading`, the guard fires first and forces the harvester to `Idle` **before**
the `Unloading` arm's payout runs. Consequences:

- The cargo currently held is **retained** (`cargo`/`gold`/`gems` are not
  cleared) — it is not destroyed, just not yet cashed.
- **No credits are booked** for that load until a real unload *completes* at a
  live refinery. With no other refinery on the map, the harvester sits idle
  holding the load indefinitely.
- If the house owns another refinery, the FSM re-homes to it on the next
  `FindHome`/`HeadingHome` cycle and banks the load normally — no loss.

**What the original does.** In RA the harvester unloads through a radio/mission
protocol (`UnitClass::Mission_Harvest` → `MISSION_ENTER`, `unit.cpp:2898+`) and
books credits **incrementally as each bail is dumped** into the refinery
(`Credit_Load`/`Harvester_Dump_List`, `unit.cpp:5003`). If the refinery is
destroyed mid-dump, the radio contact breaks; whatever bails were already dumped
are already credited, and the harvester keeps the remaining cargo and re-seeks
another refinery (or idles if none).

**Divergence + decision.** Two differences, both benign:

1. *Payout granularity.* The original credits per-bail during the dump; we credit
   the whole load atomically on unload completion. So a mid-unload destruction
   forfeits the *timing* of the current load's payout but never destroys the
   cargo — the value is deferred to a future completed unload, not lost. Because
   our model has no partial "already-dumped" state, there is nothing to
   partially credit.
2. *Re-home vs idle.* Both engines retain the cargo and re-home to another
   refinery when one exists. They differ only in the single-refinery corner
   case, which is terminal in both (nowhere to cash the load).

We **document** this divergence rather than aligning it: staged per-bail
crediting would require modelling the refinery-side dump list and the radio
protocol (out of M6 scope), and the observable outcome — cargo retained, no
phantom credits, re-home when possible — is faithful enough. No credits are ever
created or destroyed by the edge case; the invariant that credits equal
completed-unload value holds.

**Revisit when:** M7+ adds staged/animated unloading or a second-refinery
re-home is exercised in real play against Vanilla Conquer.
